### 5.2 Failover Strategy Example

```yaml
failover_strategy:
  primary:
    model: gpt-4-turbo
    provider: openai
    region: us-east-1

## 6. SEMANTIC CACHING IMPLEMENTATION

### 6.1 Caching Flow

```
1. User Request Received
   ↓
2. Generate Embedding of Prompt
   ↓
3. Vector Similarity Search (threshold: 0.95)
   ↓
4a. Cache Hit (similarity > 0.95)      4b. Cache Miss
   → Return Cached Response               → Route to LLM Provider
   → Update hit count                      → Generate Response
   → Extend TTL                            → Cache Response + Embedding
   → Log metrics                           → Return Response
```

### 6.1 Cache Configuration

```python
cache_config = {
    "similarity_threshold": 0.95,
    "ttl_days": 7,
    "max_cache_size_gb": 100,
    "eviction_policy": "LRU",
    "cache_warming": {
        "enabled": True,
        "top_queries": 100,
        "schedule": "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
    },
    "invalidation": {
        "manual": True,
        "pattern_based": True,
        "time_based": True
    }
}
```

### 6.3 Cost Savings Calculation

```python
def calculate_cache_savings(cache_hits, avg_tokens, model_costs):
    """
    Calculate cost savings from semantic caching.
    """
    total_tokens_saved = cache_hits * avg_tokens
    
    # Cost per 1K tokens for different models
    savings = 0
    for model, hit_count in cache_hits_by_model.items():
        tokens = hit_count * avg_tokens
        cost_per_1k = model_costs[model]
        savings += (tokens / 1000) * cost_per_1k
    
    # Subtract embedding costs
    embedding_cost = cache_hits * 0.0001  # $0.0001 per embedding
    
    net_savings = savings - embedding_cost
    savings_percentage = (savings / total_potential_cost) * 100
    
    return {
        "net_savings": net_savings,
        "savings_percentage": savings_percentage,
        "tokens_saved": total_tokens_saved
    }
```

## 7. RATE LIMITING & QUEUE MANAGEMENT

### 7.1 Tier-Based Rate Limits

```python
TIER_LIMITS = {
    "free": {
        "requests_per_minute": 10,
        "requests_per_day": 1000,
        "tokens_per_day": 50000,
        "burst_allowance": 5,
        "queue_priority": 1
    },
    "basic": {
        "requests_per_minute": 100,
        "requests_per_day": 50000,
        "tokens_per_day": 5000000,
        "burst_allowance": 50,
        "queue_priority": 5
    },
    "pro": {
        "requests_per_minute": 500,
        "requests_per_day": 500000,
        "tokens_per_day": 50000000,
        "burst_allowance": 200,
        "queue_priority": 10
    },
    "enterprise": {
        "requests_per_minute": 5000,
        "requests_per_day": None,  # Unlimited
        "tokens_per_day": None,    # Unlimited
        "burst_allowance": 1000,
        "queue_priority": 20
    }
}
```

### 7.2 Queue Management Logic

```python
async def handle_request(request, user):
    # Check rate limit
    if not check_rate_limit(user):
        # Add to queue
        queue_position = enqueue_request(request, user.tier)
        return {
            "status": "queued",
            "position": queue_position,
            "estimated_wait_seconds": calculate_wait_time(queue_position)
        }
    
    # Process immediately
    response = await process_request(request)
    return response

def enqueue_request(request, tier):
    priority = TIER_LIMITS[tier]["queue_priority"]
    score = priority * 1000000 + time.time()
    
    redis.zadd("requests:queue", {request.id: score})
    return redis.zrank("requests:queue", request.id)
```
